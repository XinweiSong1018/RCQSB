**Using Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning to Estimate the Livelihood Impact of Electricity Access**

Replication materials for Ratledge, Cadamuro, de la Questa, Stigler, and Burke (2022). 

This repository allows others to reproduce the figures and calculations in the main text and extended data of this paper.

If you discover meaningful errors, have questions or suggestions, contact Nathan Ratledge at ratledge@stanford.edu. 

Organization of repository:
- data/figure_and_input_data: all data used in this repo.
- scripts/figures: scripts for replication of figures and tables.
- scripts/analysis: scripts for regression analysis and related material that is not in figures.
- figures/clean: published versions of the figures.

Scripts are ordered by the figure in which they appear.  There are three main text figures and 13 extended data figures.  Each script can be run independently, includes reference to the needed data frames, includes basic instructions and lists the required packages.  Generally, there are two types of scripts for figures â€“ data preparation code and figure generation code.  See the Instructions document in the scripts folder for details.
